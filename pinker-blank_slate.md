# Preface

Seems skippable. Can we acknowledge genetic predispositions without falling into racism and sexism? Find out in this book.

# Part I
## 1. the official theory
Pinker mentions a few philosophers of centuries past:

* Rosseau, who wrote of what we call the noble savage
* Locke, who wrote of what we call the blank slate (tabula rasa)
* Descartes, who wrote of what we now call a soul; Pinker likes the term Ghost in the Machine

To this point the terms embody cartoon concepts, if only because they're being written about by people
who predate almost all of modern science.

## 2. Silly putty
First part discusses the advent in the early 1900s of stimulus-response experiments that showed
just how malleable certain behaviors can be. He then presents a series of commentators who say
things about how so much is explained by stimulus-response.

Second part talks culture, which is the source of so many stimuli. He puts forth a page of authors
of scientific and fictional works, mostly from the 1930s to 1970s, talking about how our personalities
are determined by cultural context.

# Preface

Seems skippable. Can we acknowledge genetic predispositions without falling into racism and sexism? Find out in this book.

# Part I
## 1. the official theory
Pinker mentions a few philosophers of centuries past:

* Rosseau, who wrote of what we call the noble savage
* Locke, who wrote of what we call the blank slate (tabula rasa)
* Descartes, who wrote of what we now call a soul; Pinker likes the term Ghost in the Machine

To this point the terms embody cartoon concepts, if only because they're being written about by people
who predate almost all of modern science.

## 2. Silly putty
First part discusses the advent in the early 1900s of stimulus-response experiments that showed
just how malleable certain behaviors can be. He then presents a series of commentators who say
things about how so much is explained by stimulus-response.

Second part talks culture, which is the source of so many stimuli. He puts forth a page of authors
of scientific and fictional works, mostly from the 1930s to 1970s, talking about how our personalities
are determined by cultural context.

## 3. The last wall to fall

In which Pinker starts to rebut the cartoon concepts in earnest.

Here's Pinker's outline for the chapter:

* the science of the mind, cognitive science
  * The mental world can be grounded in the physical world by the concepts of
  information, computation, and feedback.
  * The mind cannot be a blank slate, because blank slates don't do anything.
    * Here, he introduces the East Pole (MIT), where there is little innate structure 
      to the brain and everything is learned,  and the West Pole (UCSD) where the brain
      has a good amount of structure before it gets to learning.
  * An infinite range of behavior can be generated by finite combinatorial programs in the
  mind. I.e., what Chomsky said.
  * The mind is a complex system composed of many interacting parts.
* how cognition andd emotion are implemented in the brain
    * Phineas Gage is mentioned here.
* behavioral genetics
* evolutionary psychology, the study of the phylogenetic history and adaptive functions of the mind

## 4. Culture vultures

Starts with a discussion of theory of mind, and from there diverges to a discussion of how
culture evolves via emulation and learning, with a smattering of game theory. Concludes
with a discussion of how some cultures advanced faster than others because they were in a
better position (typically geographic position) for interconnecting with and learning from
neighbors.

Concludes with a note about how great it is that we can simultaneously study multiple
layers of a problem, some more reductionist and some more high-level.

## 5. The slate's last stand

BK: up to p 90, this chapter had some surprisingly weak arguments; recommend the time-pressed reader skip it.

### genetics
About how there are fewer genes, by a certain count, than had been expected, by a certain
count. That opened the way to some people commenting on how this indicates that we're less
hard-wire structured than expected. He seems to be rebutting bloggers here.

### neural networks.
As of the writing in 2003, neural network research hadn't progressed very far and wasn't
doing incredibly well. Pinker concludes that it is too reductionist and can't work.

### neural plasticity
This is just another word for `learning', so why worry about it.

# Part II

BK: all of Part II is skippable.

Just as chapter 5 is a refutation of the extreme arguments from the reductionist side,
this entire part refutes extreme arguments from the side that pushes a virtuous soul,
including the Politically Correct who didn't fully understand the implications of
sociobiology and anthropology, and the religious right who fear that the soul will
disappear in a cloud of neurons. A lot of the people being refuted are extremists who
aren't worth the time and attention Pinker gives them.

# Part III

Things Pinker promises to refute:

* If people are innately different, oppression and discrimination would be justified.
* If people are innately immoral, hopes to improve the human condition would be futile.
* If people are products of biology, free will would be a myth and we could no longer hold people responsible for their actions.
* If people are products of biology, life would have no higher meaning and purpose.

## 1. the official theory
Pinker mentions a few philosophers of centuries past:

* Rosseau, who wrote of what we call the noble savage
* Locke, who wrote of what we call the blank slate (tabula rasa)
* Descartes, who wrote of what we now call a soul; Pinker likes the term Ghost in the Machine

To this point the terms embody cartoon concepts, if only because they're being written about by people
who predate almost all of modern science.

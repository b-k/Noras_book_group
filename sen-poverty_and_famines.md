Amartya Sen, _Poverty and Famines: An essay on entitlement and deprivation_

# 1 poverty and entitlements
One is poor because one's choice set does not include a point that satisfies basic needs.
So, where does the choice set come from? Sen is comfortable pointing out that the choice
set comes from a largely abitrary set of rules of who owns what that have no serious
foundations beyond historic accident.

# 2 Concepts of poverty
Q: Is it absolute or relative poverty that matters?

A: both.

# 3 Poverty: identification and aggregation

## multidimensional v univariate
The direct method of measurement: write down a list of requisites; see if they're all met.

The income method: calculate a poverty line at which one could purchase a satisfactory
sustenance bundle; call that the univariate measure of poverty.

Sen leans toward the first method. First, there are differences in prices and access to
markets; to give a non-Sen example, there's a single U.S. poverty rate covering people
living in Manhattan, NY, or Peoria, IL. Second, there are issues of personal preference:
what if the minimum bundle is so distasteful that a person would rather be deprived?

## families

are the basic unit of analysis because prices and options clearly change relative to an
individual. But, we must bear in mind, after establishing a large household is in poverty,
that it consists of as many humans as it does.

## aggregation

Pretending this is LaTeX, $H$ is the head-count index: [heads in poverty]/[total heads].

$I$ is the `povety gap': [poverty line - avg income of the poor]/[poverty line].

In the context of the aove absolute v relative split, both of these are largely absolute
poverty measures. Notably, a transfer from one poor person to another less poor person
can't change either index. By talking about this, Sen seems to be thinking about
developing economies where the poor spend a lot of time engaging in transactions among
themselves, versus more structured economies where most transactions are with
above-poverty businesses.

Conversely, the Gini coefficient [ https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient ] is a
useful meaasure of relative deprivation. Note that Sen uses a Gini coefficient of
1=poverty line, not the usually-reported all-economy Gini that includes the now-fabled 1%.

He proposes that the only measure that meets his proposed axiomatization is this combination of the above:

$P = H \left(I + (1-I)G\right)$

BTW, see also the Foster-Greer-Thornbecke index [
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foster_Greer_Thorbecke ], that has both H and I as
special cases: by summing [income gap]^0, we get $H$, [income gap]^1 gives $I$, and the
oft-used [income gap]^2 gives extra stress to the especially poor. There's no serious
micro-foundation for using a coefficient of 2, but is sure does make the equation look
elegant, and lacking any micro-foundation, there's no reason not to use it.


# 4: starvation and famines

This is one of two interlude chapters to remind the reader of the author's thesis that 
famine is not about food availability decline (FAD). Here, the key points made are that 
starvation can happen without famine, and that declines in food production do not 
necessarily imply famine, and that low food availability plus entitlement inequality 
equals some people starving and some people doing fine.

# 5: the entitlement approach

Seems to be a rehash of the earlier discussion about how there are two ways you can fail 
to afford enough food: lack of resource entitlement, and change in the exchange value of 
your entitlement versus food. It seems to be repeated here to foreshadow the coming 
chapters.

# 6: The great Bengal famine

Sen starts to present the data that the famine was not about FAD. There are several 
points, which he attacks with many tables. 

* The food decline was questionable, and in some cases the years of the famine showed higher food intake.
* Sen tabulates changes in jobs, and finds a lot of people moving to lower-status jobs,
	notably husking paddy, which he considers to be as low-grade as it gets. Switching to a low-pay job
	immediately translates to lower access to food.
* He alludes to policies that may have made matters worse, by rationing and the indication of a panic
	which led to hoarding by those who had the bucks to do so.

Because the chapter was so focused on arguing against the intuition of FAD, it didn't 
spend much time answering the question of why the famine actually did happen. That is,
how did the pieces presented fit together into a narrative that ended in famine?

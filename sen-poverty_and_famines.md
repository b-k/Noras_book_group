Amartya Sen, _Poverty and Famines: An essay on entitlement and deprivation_

# 1 poverty and entitlements
One is poor because one's choice set does not include a point that satisfies basic needs.
So, where does the choice set come from? Sen is comfortable pointing out that the choice
set comes from a largely abitrary set of rules of who owns what that have no serious
foundations beyond historic accident.

# 2 Concepts of poverty
Q: Is it absolute or relative poverty that matters?

A: both.

# 3 Poverty: identification and aggregation

## multidimensional v univariate
The direct method of measurement: write down a list of requisites; see if they're all met.

The income method: calculate a poverty line at which one could purchase a satisfactory
sustenance bundle; call that the univariate measure of poverty.

Sen leans toward the first method. First, there are differences in prices and access to
markets; to give a non-Sen example, there's a single U.S. poverty rate covering people
living in Manhattan, NY, or Peoria, IL. Second, there are issues of personal preference:
what if the minimum bundle is so distasteful that a person would rather be deprived?

## families

are the basic unit of analysis because prices and options clearly change relative to an
individual. But, we must bear in mind, after establishing a large household is in poverty,
that it consists of as many humans as it does.

## aggregation

Pretending this is LaTeX, $H$ is the head-count index: [heads in poverty]/[total heads].

$I$ is the `povety gap': [poverty line - avg income of the poor]/[poverty line].

In the context of the aove absolute v relative split, both of these are largely absolute
poverty measures. Notably, a transfer from one poor person to another less poor person
can't change either index. By talking about this, Sen seems to be thinking about
developing economies where the poor spend a lot of time engaging in transactions among
themselves, versus more structured economies where most transactions are with
above-poverty businesses.

Conversely, the Gini coefficient [ https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient ] is a
useful meaasure of relative deprivation. Note that Sen uses a Gini coefficient of
1=poverty line, not the usually-reported all-economy Gini that includes the now-fabled 1%.

He proposes that the only measure that meets his proposed axiomatization is this combination of the above:

$P = H \left(I + (1-I)G\right)$

BTW, see also the Foster-Greer-Thornbecke index [
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foster_Greer_Thorbecke ], that has both H and I as
special cases: by summing [income gap]^0, we get $H$, [income gap]^1 gives $I$, and the
oft-used [income gap]^2 gives extra stress to the especially poor. There's no serious
micro-foundation for using a coefficient of 2, but is sure does make the equation look
elegant, and lacking any micro-foundation, there's no reason not to use it.

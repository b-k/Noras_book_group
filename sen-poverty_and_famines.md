Amartya Sen, _Poverty and Famines: An essay on entitlement and deprivation_

# 1 poverty and entitlements
One is poor because one's choice set does not include a point that satisfies basic needs.
So, where does the choice set come from? Sen is comfortable pointing out that the choice
set comes from a largely abitrary set of rules of who owns what that have no serious
foundations beyond historic accident.

# 2 Concepts of poverty

Q: Is it absolute or relative poverty that matters?

A: both.

## Modern Research (HH)

There's a bunch of contemporary social science research on the relationships among poverty, stress, and decision-making.

* https://www.princeton.edu/~joha/
* (and many other citations from google searches)

Maybe poverty should be defined by being in a psychological state where stress from food and other resources scarcity causes you to be unable to reliably make decisions well? 

# 3 Poverty: identification and aggregation

## multidimensional v univariate
The direct method of measurement: write down a list of requisites; see if they're all met.

The income method: calculate a poverty line at which one could purchase a satisfactory
sustenance bundle; call that the univariate measure of poverty.

Sen leans toward the first method. First, there are differences in prices and access to
markets; to give a non-Sen example, there's a single U.S. poverty rate covering people
living in Manhattan, NY, or Peoria, IL. Second, there are issues of personal preference:
what if the minimum bundle is so distasteful that a person would rather be deprived?

## families

are the basic unit of analysis because prices and options clearly change relative to an
individual. But, we must bear in mind, after establishing a large household is in poverty,
that it consists of as many humans as it does.

## aggregation

Pretending this is LaTeX, $H$ is the head-count index: [heads in poverty]/[total heads].

$I$ is the `povety gap': [poverty line - avg income of the poor]/[poverty line].

In the context of the aove absolute v relative split, both of these are largely absolute
poverty measures. Notably, a transfer from one poor person to another less poor person
can't change either index. By talking about this, Sen seems to be thinking about
developing economies where the poor spend a lot of time engaging in transactions among
themselves, versus more structured economies where most transactions are with
above-poverty businesses.

Conversely, the Gini coefficient [ https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient ] is a
useful meaasure of relative deprivation. Note that Sen uses a Gini coefficient of
1=poverty line, not the usually-reported all-economy Gini that includes the now-fabled 1%.

He proposes that the only measure that meets his proposed axiomatization is this combination of the above:

$P = H \left(I + (1-I)G\right)$

BTW, see also the Foster-Greer-Thornbecke index [
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foster_Greer_Thorbecke ], that has both H and I as
special cases: by summing [income gap]^0, we get $H$, [income gap]^1 gives $I$, and the
oft-used [income gap]^2 gives extra stress to the especially poor. There's no serious
micro-foundation for using a coefficient of 2, but is sure does make the equation look
elegant, and lacking any micro-foundation, there's no reason not to use it.

## Questions from HH

* What's wrong with Bengal grams??
* Is poverty an instantaneous state? Or do you have to be poor (by some definition) for a
certain amount of time to count as impoverished?
* What about debt and non-liquid assets? 

# 4: starvation and famines

This is one of two interlude chapters to remind the reader of the author's thesis that 
famine is not about food availability decline (FAD). Here, the key points made are that 
starvation can happen without famine, and that declines in food production do not 
necessarily imply famine, and that low food availability plus entitlement inequality 
equals some people starving and some people doing fine.

# 5: the entitlement approach

Seems to be a rehash of the earlier discussion about how there are two ways you can fail 
to afford enough food: lack of resource entitlement, and change in the exchange value of 
your entitlement versus food. It seems to be repeated here to foreshadow the coming 
chapters.

# 6: The great Bengal famine

Sen starts to present the data that the famine was not about FAD. There are several 
points, which he attacks with many tables. 

* The food decline was questionable, and in some cases the years of the famine showed higher food intake.
* Sen tabulates changes in jobs, and finds a lot of people moving to lower-status jobs,
	notably husking paddy, which he considers to be as low-grade as it gets. Switching to a low-pay job
	immediately translates to lower access to food.
* He alludes to policies that may have made matters worse, by rationing and the indication of a panic
	which led to hoarding by those who had the bucks to do so.

Because the chapter was so focused on arguing against the intuition of FAD, it didn't 
spend much time answering the question of why the famine actually did happen. That is,
how did the pieces presented fit together into a narrative that ended in famine?

## HH thoughts

* The paragraph of quotes from commissioners on p. 55 is remarkable. I hereby remark on it.
* He mentions, briefly, that the famine might have been due to sharp inflation, apparently due
to an overheated and poorly regulated wartime economy, where the Raj was printing money to get
materiel for the war effort. It's interesting/bad how this boom/bust pattern works.
* "Institutional arrangements, including wage systems, were slow to adjust to the new reality" -- p. 78.

# 7 The Ethiopian famine

## 7.3 Wollo
One region was especially hard-hit, but Table 7.4 shows that prices for grain and seeds in
that region didn't go up. "People starved to death without there being a substantial rise
in food price." [p 96] He debates with a theory that there were road blockages to contend
with. Rather, those who were starving were largely farmers who could neither buy nor sell food
at the market.


## 7.4 Who?
This section attempts to piece toghether additional evidence to back up that it was
farmers who were hit by the famine. Sen is cautious and acknowledges that the data is OK
at best.

## 7.5
BTW, the farmers often had hired hands, who were often given food/shelter for labor. With
no work to do, they'd be let go, with zero economic power and really nowhere to go.

## 7.6 Pastoralists
I.e., animal herders, who were already being squeezed by the diminishing access to good
grazing land, which was increasingy being turned into agricultural fields.

Nobody lives on animal products alone; the animal herders still need to buy grains.
Above, prices in Wollo had held steady, so we expect those animal herders may have done
OK. But in other areas, the prices did shift unfavorably. Sen thus distinguishes between
the Wollo famine, which hit plant-raising people, and the Southern famine, which hit
animal-raising people.

## HH thoughts

* p. 99 talks about the interactions between mobility, and the ability/inclination to 
move, and poverty. This is of current interest too: http://www.rstreet.org/op-ed/lets-move-a-better-approach-to-poverty/ and others. (I recall a more recent essay, but can't find it.)
* The multiplier effect of various agricultural failures seems important. Is this less true for more diverse economies?
* Animals seem like a terrible sort of weath, if their value collapses in case of famine. Poor pastoralists.

# 8 The Sahel

The Sahel is a semi-arid belt in West Africa, at the Southern end of the Sahara Desert;
see map on p 130.

## 8.2 FAD is right for once
For once, there actually was a serious decline in food availability, making this famine a
"comforting bosom" [p 118] for the FAD fans.

## 8.3

But we need something beyond FAD to explain who would be hardest hit. In this case, it was
the animal-raising nomads, for reasons very similar to 7.6 above.

## HH thoughts

* [transhumance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumance) -- pastoral lifestyle involving seasonal alternation of homes
* Interesting discussion of how crop insurance needs to be set up (at the family level) to be effective. Traditional insurance methods such as storing meat on the hoof falls apart because of collapsing demand.

# 9 Bangladesh, 1974

* [langarkhana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langar_Khana) -- place in an Islamic shrine where rice is cooked for the poor
* Government imports collapsed during the worst of the famine because of US pressure to stop trading with Cuba.
* There was actually a pretty good crop that year, despite the floods in June through September, and the worst parts of the famine happened in areas with the best crop yields.
* Prices rose well before the floods happened. 
* The hardest hit were laborers with minimal land assets, whose purchase power collapsed and who couldn't eat their labor. 
* Explanation is not fully clear.
 
# 10 Entitlements and Deprivation

* "Whatever may be the oracular power of the FAD view, it is certainly Delphic in its reticence." Oh, snap!
* Sen doesn't see overall issues with total food availability. 
* Insteresting list of policy directions on p159.
* Colonial non-interventionism during famines is the worst. Due to misunderstanding of Smith/capitalism. Lack of food actually reduces purchasing power, decreasing likelihood of imports, not increasing it.

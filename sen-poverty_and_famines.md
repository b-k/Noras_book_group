Amartya Sen, _Poverty and Famines: An essay on entitlement and deprivation_

# 1 poverty and entitlements
One is poor because one's choice set does not include a point that satisfies basic needs.
So, where does the choice set come from? Sen is comfortable pointing out that the choice
set comes from a largely abitrary set of rules of who owns what that have no serious
foundations beyond historic accident.

# 2 Concepts of poverty
Q: Is it absolute or relative poverty that matters?

A: both.

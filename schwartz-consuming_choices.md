Consuming Choices, David T Schwartz

## Preface

Seems skippable. What ethical approaches can be applied to the question of how culpable
consumers are in the inevitable unethical acts committed by producers?

## 1. Ethical consumerism

A few introductory examples:

* Tourists in an exotic locale are about to buy a well-made but very underpriced suit when
they are told that the suit is so inexpensive thanks to slave labor.
* A buyer falls in love with a table, but finds out that the beautiful wood is from an
endangered species of tree.
* A delightful food additive turns out to be derived from the musk glands of civets,
foxes, and mink, who are kept in terrible conditions.
* Jane loves her farmer's market vendor, but sees a sign by the register that 15% of
proceeds go to a white supremacist group.

The third example is barely mentioned later, because it's a stand-in for concentrated
animal feeding operations (CAFOs), which are unquestionably terrible for the animals.
Although the example allows all readers a third-person perspective, the rest of the book
is not shy about asking readers to consider whether the only ethical choice is to not eat
meat. His answer in Ch 5 will surprise you!

The discussion of these examples foreshadows the approaches taken:

* Consequentialist (ch 3): if your failure to buy causes no change in the harm the
  producer causes, does it matter?
*  A deontological approach (ch 4): "As Kant himself writes, "Act so as to treat
humanity, whether in your own person or that of another, always as an end and never
as a mere means.' " The author never addresses how treatment of producers as a mere
means describes _all of capitalism_.
* Self-definition of character, which gets less discussion in Ch 5. P 20: "But since the
  enlightenment, philosophers have shifted their emphasis away from evaluating character
and toward evaluating actions."

## 2. Caveat emptor

The bulk of the chapter is a list of ways in which producers could be unethical, which would all be familiar to the
typical reader, but it's the job of a philosophy text to at least neatly categorize them.

* During production: sweat shops and literal slavery, pollution and environmental damage, CAFOs.
* During marketing: marketing cigarettes to kids, objectifying portrayals of women.
* During use: users commit environmental destruction (some fertilizers, mowers with
crappy exhaust controls). I'd imagine this category could be extended, e.g., products
that could harm others when used less-than-cautiously.
* Ancillary issues: the contributions to the white supremacists in the example above.

These are split into direct harm to others, injustice such as
unequal pay due to gender or race, utilitarian bad outcomes like a society where income
disparities are huge and civil society is damaged, and moral offense.

The author again states that "moral offense arguably generates the weakest claim upon us as moral
agents; said another way, moral offense generates a lower level of moral obligation." [p
41] This is partly because it is far more subjective than the other
categories. But he's willing to concede that some moral offense is due to a specific
problem in one of the above categories, and his examples (racist stereotypes on clothing,
sexualizing clothing marketed to kids, ads encouraging people to over-imbibe) all arguable
fall into one of the above categories. He's probably right that some moral offenses really
are subjective (remember the whole thing about how rock music leads to satanism?)

## 3. Consumer as causal agent

The collective action problem, or as summarized on p 50: "if I don’t buy this morally
tainted product, someone else will, and hence it makes no difference whether or not I buy it."
If we're consequentialist, failing to buy a product only matters if it
prevents further manufacture, but that's a probability zero event.

The chapter leans heavily on Christopher Kutz’s _Complicity: Ethics and Law for a
Collective Age_, almost to the point that I want to just go read that.
Traditional ethics assumed individual-level action led to individual level
consequences (like a lot of legal cases and stories), and that's hard to adapt to
indirect effects of collective decisions.

The chapter rebuts in various ways:

* Rule utilitarianism [p 57]: if everybody did this thing, what would the society look
  like?

* The threshold argument [p 59ff]: there's one person whose failure to buy would tip over to the
production of one less cow, one less order from the wholesaler, &c. Then it's a
probability game: with some small odds, your action is very significant; with large odds
you have no effect. Then it's reasonable to ascribe responsibility proportionate to the
odds to all actors. Also, your failing to buy pushes forward the time when the cow-tipping
happens, and the temporal aspect is also valuable.

* By advertising a refusal to buy, you may be able to get others to also opt out.
Vegetarians beget more vegetarians. This implies a multiplying effect such that if you
convince ten people to join you, your effect is not ε, but maybe 10ε.

* We know that if everybody fails to buy, then there is a real effect.  If the value
is truly infinitesimal, then the sum of a finite number of actions can't add to a
positive, real effect. Therefore, the value of one action can't be truly infinitesimal.

## 4. Consumer as complicit participant

Setting aside the question of consequentialism, there's simple complicity: the bombing
of Dresden happened because of bomber pilots, scientists and engineers, and cafeteria
workers. 

This section also pulls heavily from Kutz. E.g., he writes: "participants in a
collective harm are accountable for the victims' suffering, not because of the
individual differences they make, but because their intentional participation in a
collective endeavor directly links them to the consequences of that endeavor." [p 72]

OK, we can ascribe responsibility on the bombers and scientists, having decided that the
"if I didn't do it somebody else would" argument doesn't hold enough water. So what about
the cafeteria workers? Here the distinction made about intention comes in to play,
because the cafeteria worker's goal is to get paid and go home, without regard to the
goal of bombing Dresden. So, that seems sensible.

P 76: a distinction is made between structured collectives like a corporate or military
hierarchy, and unstructured, like a bunch of consumers. The author indicates that the
distinction just makes it harder to measure complicity, not that it absolves consumers.

P 82: "This benefit [from consuming] is less like the benefits of drawing a salary
and more like an emotional benefit, an engaged feeling of satisfaction derived from
(and perhaps peculiar to) obtaining, possessing, and using a consumer product."

I (BK) didn't get a lot of conclusions out of this one. A key point to carry into Ch 5,
though, is that there's a continuous scale of complicity, depending on the organization,
intent, and proximity in an abstract sense to the harm.

## 5. Toward a practical consumer ethic

Because complicity is continuous and not just guilt or innocence, it's a question of
most effectively allocating resources to minimize bad effects.

As above, the author ranks the effects in Ch 2, harm, bad consequences, moral offense, in
that order, and so advises that consumers focus more on the first and less on the third.

Are there _obligatory_ boycotts? The author seems to restrict obligatory boycotts to those
that cause direct harm, though maybe that's too loose a reading. At the other end of the
spectrum, efforts to define one's character via moral actions are taken as subjective and
therefore much less obligatory.

Eating CAFO meat is taken to be a clear case of harm, so the author is unapologetic
in stating that eating CAFO meat is out. But the author cops out after that: "For the
sake of wider appeal, I grant the general permissibility of meat eating..." He sides with
Michael Pollan on how meat from happy farms is fine. [Not his words, but certainly
his gist. Peter Singer's writing on this topic is cited about twice in this book, in passing.]

Section IV covers the economists who state that sweat shop labor is a good thing, because
it is better than alternatives for somebody in an impoverished country, and is a step
toward modernization/greater welfare all around. As people at the World Bank have joked to
me: "The only thing worse than being exploited is not being exploited!" In this case, the
problem is not low wages, but working conditions, which are still a harm and something
consumers can push for improving.

The author pushes readers to educate themselves, with a brief rant about people who
decline to listen to discussion of ethical sourcing because they just don't want to know.

Otherwise, no hard conclusions. Intentions matter, effect is on a continuous scale, and we
have limited resources to devote and so need to select how to best minimize our damage.

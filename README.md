Notes on Hanna Arendt's _Human Condition_ for our book group

## 0 Prologue

¡Sputnik!

## I The human condition

Arendt introduces the difference between labor, work, and action.



#### 2. the term _vita activa_

"This is mortality: to move along a rectilinear line in a universe where everything, if it
moves at all, moves in a cyclical order." [p 19]

## II The public and private realm

#### 5. the _polis_ and the household

in which "privacy" is linked back to "deprived"

## III Labor


## IV Work

## V Action

#### 32 The process character of action

Because action is social, and we can't control others, all action has unpredictable
consequences. "Nowehere, in other words, ... does man appear to be less free than in those
capacities whose very essence is freedom." [p 234]

#### 33 Irreversibility and the power to forgive

A follow-up to 32, that things set in a bad course can more or less be forgiven and
forgotten.

"men are unable to forgive what they cannot punish and that they are unable to punish what
has turned out to be unforgivable" [p 241], which Arendt uses to define "radical evil".

## VI The _vita activa_ and the modern age

"He found the Archimedian point, but he used it against himself; it seems that he was
permitted to find it only under this condition." F Kafka, p 248. This opening is so
perfect that I wonder which came first, Arendt seeing this line or Arendt writing the
chapter.

#### 35 World alienation (⇐band name idea)

p 255, footnote 5 advocates for a guaranteed minimum wage.

#### 36 The discovery of the Archimedean point

In which the telescope is credited with ushering in modernity

#### 37 Universial versus natural science

"the curious discrepancy between the mood of modern philosophy, which from the beginning
had been predominantly pessimistic, and the mood of modern science, which until very
recently had been so bouyantly optimistic, has been bridged. There seems to be little
cheerfulness left in either of them." [p 273]

#### 38 The rise of Cartesian doubt

In which Descartes introduces fundamental doubt.

"intelligibility to human understanding does not at all constitute a demonstration of
truth, just as visibility did not at all constitute proof of reality." [p 275]

#### 39 introspection and the loss of common sense

#### 40 Thought and the modern world

"the systems of non-Euclidian mathematics were found without any forethought of
applicability or even empirical meaning before they gained their surprising validity in
Einstein's theory" [p 285] but the simplest non-Euclidian geometry is geometry on a
sphere, which had practical geo-metric application.

#### 41 The reversal of contemplation and action

"the watch... was not invented for purposes of practical life, but exclusively for the
highly 'theoretical' purpose of conducting certain experiments with nature." [CITATION
NEEDED] [p 289]

#### 43 The defeat of _homo faber_ and the principle of happiness

"only one who is in pain really senses nothing but himself." [p 310]

"for no matter how current certain ideas might be during a given period, there never are
two philosophers who could arrive at identical formulations without copying from each
other." [p 311, fn 74]

#### 44 Life as the highest good

Christian doctrine "had reversed the ancient relationship between man and world and
promoted the most mortal thing, human life, to the position of immortality" [p 314]

p 319: the thread of Cartesian doubt and religious (esp Christian) belief are
fundamentally at odds. (⇒current U.S. political polarization)

Notes on Hanna Arendt's _Human Condition_ for our book group

## 0 Prologue

¡Sputnik!

## I The human condition

Arendt introduces the difference between labor, work, and action.



#### 2. the term _vita activa_

"This is mortality: to move along a rectilinear line in a universe where everything, if it
moves at all, moves in a cyclical order." [p 19]

## II The public and private realm

#### 5. the _polis_ and the household

in which "privacy" is linked back to "deprived"

## III Labor


## IV Work

## V Action

## VI The _vita activa_ and the modern age

#### 39 introspection and the loss of common senseo

In which Descartes introduces fundamental doubt.

#### 40 Thought and the modern world

"the systems of non-Euclidian mathematics were found without any forethought of
applicability or even empirical meaning before they gained their surprising validity in
Einstein's theory" [p 285] but the simplest non-Euclidian geometry is geometry on a
sphere, which had practical geo-metric application.

#### 41 The reversal of contemplation and action

"the watch... was not invented for purposes of practical life, but exclusively for the
highly 'theoretical' purpose of conducting certain experiments with nature." [CITATION
NEEDED] [p 289]

#### 43 The defeat of _homo faber_ and the principle of happiness

"only one who is in pain really senses nothing but himself." [p 310]

"for no matter how current certain ideas might be during a given period, there never are
two philosophers who could arrive at identical formulations without copying from each
other." [p 311, fn 74]

#### 44 Life as the highest good

Christian doctrine "had reversed the ancient relationship between man and world and
promoted the most mortal thing, human life, to the position of immortality" [p 314]

p 319: the thread of Cartesian doubt and religious (esp Christian) belief are
fundamentally at odds. (⇒current U.S. political polarization)
